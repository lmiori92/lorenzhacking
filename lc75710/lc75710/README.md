LC75710 VFD Display Driver IC Library
=====================================

It is common to find this sort of ICs in old electronics, as I did!
Moreover, VDF displays are pretty nice so why not writing down a simple
and bare library to handle the communication and the low-level commands.

Installation
============

The library is installed as usual by copying its contents in the
$HOME/Arduino/libraries folder.
If you are lazy enough and you trust my install.sh Bash script, then:
$ ./install
is enough to install it.

Version
=======

1.0 - initial release
