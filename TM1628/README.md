TM1628 / AM1628 / similar xx1628 clones Library
====================================================


This work wants to be an improvement of

https://code.google.com/p/tm1628/

It will feature in the future a kind of modularity
to define different types of displays (wiring and so on)

Currently it is only an adaptation for the particular display I have.

Don't expect clean code for the moment :)

TODOs

1) C conversion. No C++ is necessary...
2) Modularity for display types definitions
3) Application code ;)
